Flight price Prediction

Pre-requisites
1.Python
2.Jupyter/Anaconda
3.Streamlit
4.Installing mandatory Libraries(Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, seaborn)
5.Knowledge on algorithms

Overview

The objective of the study is to analyse the flight booking dataset obtained from “Ease My Trip” website and to conduct various statistical hypothesis tests in order to get meaningful information from it. The 'Linear Regression' statistical algorithm would be used to train the dataset and predict a continuous target variable. 'Easemytrip' is an internet platform for booking flight tickets, and hence a platform that potential passengers use to buy tickets. A thorough study of the data will aid in the discovery of valuable insights that will be of enormous value to passengers.
